Capstone App

1. What am I'm trying to solve

BidPros is a fundraising website designed to simplify the fundraising component of a non-profit event. Fundraising includes
silent auction items, live auction items, donations, raffles, and many other fundraising ideas. The market is missing the right
combination of ease-of-use and available features. Guest interactions will be almost 95% mobile and 5% from a computer. Admin
access is typically the complete opposite.

BidPros will grow through a subscription based model (VERY low buy-in cost) with a 1.2% credit card processing fee in addition
to standard credit card processing (typically around 3%).

2. Who will interact with the App

Admins, organization leaders and volunteers, and guests, people purchasing items or donating to the organization, will interact 
with the application to generate funds for the organization. Ease of use will focus heavily on guests' mobile phone numbers and 
text message functionality.
